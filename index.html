            <h2 class="title-light">About Me</h2>
            <p class="p-light">I am a trained social worker and have been working in this field since 2015. In July
                2024, I decided to
                build my knowledge in programming and web development. Previously, I completed my first year of network
                management studies in higher education before choosing a different path. Now, I'm eager to develop web
                development skills so I can work on side projects alongside my main role, and perhaps even consider a
                career shift in the future.</p>

            <h2 class="title-light">HTML 5 & CSS 3</h2>
            <p class="p-light">I started by learning the basics of HTML, the first step in my journey to becoming a web
                developer. This
                allowed me to explore, for the first time, the structure of a web page.</p>
            <p class="p-light">Next, I learned to use CSS. This allowed me to understand how HTML elements are
                structured on a web page
                and also how to optimize the display of information on the page.</p>
            <h2 class="title-light">JavaScript</h2>
            <p class="p-light">I then learned to use JavaScript. It required some conceptual and abstract thinking, but
                persistence and
                dedication always pay off! JavaScript helped me understand how data is structured using variables and
                how to interact with HTML elements. It's an incredibly powerful language. I plan to use JavaScript for
                both front-end and back-end development.</p>

            <h3 class="title-light">Full-stack engineer</h3>
            <p class="p-light">I want to leverage my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to become a full-stack
                engineer. Alongside my
                role as a social worker, I aim to create an additional income stream by offering my new skills to design
                and manage stylish, user-friendly, and accessible websites for all types of clients from start to
                finish.</p>
