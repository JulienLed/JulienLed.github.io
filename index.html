            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a trained social worker and have been working in this field since 2015. In July 2024, I decided to build my knowledge in programming and web development. Previously, I completed my first year of network management studies in higher education before choosing a different path. Now, Iâ€™m eager to develop web development skills so I can work on side projects alongside my main role, and perhaps even consider a career shift in the future.</p>

            <h2>HTML 5</h2>
            <p>I started by learning the basics of HTML, the first step in my journey to becoming a web developer. This allowed me to explore, for the first time, the structure of a web page.</p>
